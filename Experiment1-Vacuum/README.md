# Physics Lab: Advanced Experiments 1
This repository stores the raw data, processed data and data processing tools that were used during the experiments of the [Physics Lab: Advanced Experiments 1](https://ocasys.rug.nl/current/catalog/course/WBPH074-05) course at the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/).

## Vacuum Systems
The files for the **Vacuum Systems** experiment can be found in [Experiment1-Vacuum](./Experiment1-Vacuum). The raw data can be found in [Experiment1-Vacuum/backup](./Experiment1-Vacuum/backup). The (pre)processed data can be found in [Experiment1-Vacuum/data](./Experiment1-Vacuum/data). The figures in [Experiment1-Vacuum/figures](./Experiment1-Vacuum/figures) were exported using the [data_processing.ipynb](./Experiment1-Vacuum/data_processing.ipynb) Jupyter notebook.
